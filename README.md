# TOdoDO ✅

This is a learning project where I'm building a **full-stack Todo List app** using **Next.js**.

Right now, I’m focusing on the **frontend** — exploring layouts, routing, components, state management, and Tailwind CSS.

### What's next?
I'll gradually add:
- ✅ Backend integration using API routes
- ✅ Database (probably with MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Authentication
- ✅ Full CRUD functionality

Feel free to explore or drop suggestions!
